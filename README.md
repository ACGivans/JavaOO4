Housing Options.

The purpose of this program is to allow the user to add various 
    housing options. The options are to rent an apartment, buy a 
    Town House or buy a house. Various options will be entered, 
    and they differ for each object, which is why there are objects 
    that extend other objects. The options for all objects are how 
    many bathrooms and bedrooms there are. The options for an 
    apartment are how much rent will be, and whether or not there 
    will be parking. The options for a townhouse and a house are 
    the monthly mortgage rate, tax rate, and insurance costs. For 
    single-family homes, there will be a monthly association fee 
    as well as the size of the lot in acres. After each object is 
    entered, the credentials are displayed. When the user indicates 
    they are finished, a summary report is printed.
